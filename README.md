Hello-World
===============

My first repository

I am a professor of Economics and Statistics in the Albers School of Business and Economics at Seattle University. I am currently taking the Data Science Specializtion on Coursera from John Hopkins to learn more about data analytics. My general interests are in environmental and agricultural economics, but am also interested in a variety of policy and business applications of economics and statistics.
